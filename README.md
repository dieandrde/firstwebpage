My first web project, dedicated to the video game "Remember Me" (2013) Developed by DonÂ´t Nod Entertainment and directed by Jean-Maxime Moris. Published by Capcom.
I was attracted by a brilliant soundtrack (made by Olivier Deriviere), by its artistic design, (directed by Aleksi Briclot) and by its concept set in a dystopian future, worthy of an Orwellian work.
